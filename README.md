# linear-stats

This is a program that performs mathematical operations. I reads data from a file in this case data.txt provided and the calculates the Linear Regression Line and the Pearson Correlation Coefficent for the data.

This data represents a graph in which the values of the x axis are the number of the lines (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...) and the values of the y axis are the actual numbers (189, 113, 121, 114, 145, 110...).


# Usage
```sh
go run . data.txt # data.txt will be provided.

```
# example
```sh 
go run .
Linear Regression Line: y = -0.000330x + -242.513872
Pearson Correlation Coefficient: -0.0080906200
```
